# World Builder Simulation

A browser-based 3D simulation prototype using Three.js where an avatar constructs a world in an object-based style. The avatar learns building techniques through trial and error, simulating computational learning with visible logs of successes, failures, and improvements.

## Features

- Anime-inspired ethereal visual style
- Terraced farm landscape with elevation
- Avatar places furniture, walls, crops, bushes, and trees
- Organized farming areas with crop plots
- Learning simulation with success rate tracking
- Lightweight for smooth browser performance
- Static site deployable via GitHub Pages

## How to Run Locally

1. Clone the repository
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser, or serve with a local server (e.g., `python3 -m http.server`)

## Deployment to GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repository settings
2. Under "Pages", select "Deploy from a branch"
3. Choose "main" branch and "/ (root)" folder
4. Save and wait for deployment

The site will be available at `https://acoliyase.github.io/World/`

## Technologies

- Three.js for 3D rendering
- TensorFlow.js for potential ML simulation (included but not fully implemented in prototype)
- Open-source assets and libraries
